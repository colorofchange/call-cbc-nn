  <li>I’m calling because our communities need you to stand up for net neutrality.</li>
  <li>Net neutrality keeps the Internet diverse and open, and gives Black people and businesses an equal chance online.</li>
  <li>It’s fueling a new civil rights movement. Everyone who cares about civil rights should fight for net neutrality.</li>
  <li>The FCC’s new open Internet rules are the best way to protect net neutrality, and they are a huge civil rights victory.</li>
  <li>I want you to fight back against aggressive Republican effort to overturn this historic win. You sit on a committee whose Republican members are attacking net neutrality.</li>
  <li>I’m asking you not to align yourself with telecom lobbyists, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Marsha Blackburn in this senseless witch hunt against the President and the FCC.</li>
